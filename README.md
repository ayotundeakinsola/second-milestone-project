# UX
Basically, the website is for my girlfriend. She's a student in The Netherlands and she does make up services as a part time job.
Currently, her online presence is only on Instagram and on facebook. She feels that for her business to get proper exposure, she needs to 
have a website. So in essence, she needs a website in order to boost her online presence and also to have a web presence which hitherto, 
was missing. 
This project is going to provide the layout for her website when it gets hosted eventually. This project isn't just to be graded but 
the goal is fot it to be hosted and actually be the official website for my girlfriend.

I personally feel that by buildong a website for my girlfriend, it would boost her business image online and also attract more customers.

# Testing

I used the following webistes to validate both my HTML and CSS files respectively.

* [HTML-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input "HTML-Validator")

* [CSS-validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input "CSS-validator")

The HTML validation service  helps check the validity of Web documents. When I used this service, it only brought out error messages for the form 
in the contact section. I have tried correcting the bugs but it doesn't seem to work. On the front end, the codes for the forms seems to be working
very fine but on the other hand, the code seems to be working fine. Perhaps in future testing, I would find a way to solve it. 

Also, the CSS validation service helps check Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). When I used this service, it reported no error. The testing went well and
I am fully confident in the style sheet.
